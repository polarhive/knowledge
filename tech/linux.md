# GNU/Linux

## "GNU" in the GNU/Linux name doesn't necessarily mean GNU software

GNU + Linux + X11/Wayland + many other components make up a good, [libre OS](https://polarhive.ml/blog/free-libre-software/) that puts the user in [control](https://polarhive.ml/blog/how-i-do-my-computing/). Linux is a cool name but doesn't signify 'freedom' or the original goal behind the hacker ecosystem.  

### What each word implies

- GNU = Software licensed under a (libre license)
- Linux = The core of the OS (kernel)
- UNIX = Proprietary (non-freedom giving) software

UNIX was a popular proprietary OS back in the day and today it implies proprietary software incarnate in the form of Windows/MacOS or standalone cross device apps/addons.

So what's GNU? - GNU's Not UNIX :P, **GNU's not proprietary software.**
