- [Phones Make Me Counter Productive](https://polarhive.ml/blog/phones-make-me-counter-productive) - I don't like the idea of having to organize & log everything digitally on a phone using a todo app, that time can be better spent on actually getting stuff done! 
- tell people your goals
- write down stuff
- turn off notifications
- separate your entertainment zone from your study/work zone
- use [Anki Cards](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.ichi2.anki/) to revise
- cold showers (especially when you're sleepy)
