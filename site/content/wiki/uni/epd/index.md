Electronics is the study and application of electronic principles and devices, forming the foundation of modern technology. Key principles include Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, and the concepts of power and energy. Basic electronic devices include resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits (ICs). These components are essential for creating a wide range of electronic devices and systems.
