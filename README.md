# Everything I know ðŸŒ±

## Hi I'm [Nathan](https://polarhive.ml/) ðŸ‘‹ this is my knowledge wiki

A digital-garden. Where I share interesting things I have learnt so far, about this world. I hope that they would be useful to you.

> *A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. [â€”â€‰Robert Heinlein, Time Enough for Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man)*
