# Everything I know ðŸŒ±

## Hi. I'm [Nathan](https://polarhive.net/) â€” this is my knowledge wiki

A digital-garden where I share interesting things:

> *A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a
> hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build
> a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate,
> act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a
> computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization
> is for insects. [â€”â€‰Robert Heinlein, Time Enough for
> Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man)*
